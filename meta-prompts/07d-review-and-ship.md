# Review & Ship

> Reviews use the scoring rubric at `.github/REVIEW_RUBRIC.md` (6 categories: Correctness, Test Coverage, Security, Performance, Style, Documentation). PR creation uses the extended template with sections (Spec Reference, AC Evidence, Model & Branch, Review Checklist, Bug Log). The Agent Routing Matrix in `AGENTS.md` recommends assigning a different model for review than the one that implemented. See `AGENTS.md → Workflow Phases`.

**Standing rules for all sessions:**

- Follow `AGENTS.md` and workflow contracts in `/workflow/PLAYBOOK.md`, `/workflow/FILE_CONTRACTS.md`, and `/workflow/FAILURE_ROUTING.md`.
- Reference `.github/REVIEW_RUBRIC.md` for scoring criteria.
- Every artifact produced (spec, task file, test, implementation, review report) is committed or written to its canonical location before moving on.
- Fresh context means: no prior conversation carried forward. When indicated, end the current session and begin a new one.

## Review & Ship

**Covers:** Review, Cross-Review, PR Create, and preparation for Human Review

**Purpose:** Review completed feature branches in bulk. For each branch, verify against the spec, produce a structured report, and — if it passes — create the pull request. This session can process multiple completed features sequentially. Ideally, the reviewing agent is different from the one that built the feature.

**Session inputs:** One or more feature names that are labeled `status:implemented`. Provide them one at a time or as a list.

```text
You are reviewing completed feature branches and preparing them for merge. You will process one feature at a time through review, and if it passes, create its pull request.

For each feature, work through the following:

REVIEW PHASE
Read the spec at /specs/[feature-id]-[slug].md, the task file at /tasks/[feature-id]-[slug].md, and the full diff of the feature branch against the target branch.

Evaluate every item below. For each, report PASS or FAIL with specific evidence.

Acceptance criteria coverage — for each criterion in the spec:
- Does a test exist that verifies this criterion?
- Does the implementation satisfy the criterion?
- Report: PASS with test location, or FAIL with what is missing.

Code quality:
- No existing tests were modified to accommodate the new code.
- No files outside the spec's Affected Areas were changed.
- No hardcoded values, secrets, or environment-specific strings.
- No functions over 50 lines.
- No dead code or unused imports.
- Error handling is explicit, not silent.
- Naming is consistent with existing codebase conventions.

Produce a summary:
- Total criteria: [N], Passed: [N], Failed: [N]
- Code quality issues: [list or "None"]

If ALL checks pass:
- State: "Review PASSED for [feature-id]-[slug]."
- Proceed to PR Create below.

If ANY check fails:
- List each failure with the specific fix needed.
- State: "Review FAILED for [feature-id]-[slug]. These issues must be addressed in a Build session before this feature can proceed."
- Do not create a PR. Move to the next feature if there are more to review.

CROSS-REVIEW (when applicable)
If you are a different agent or model than the one that built AND initially reviewed this feature, your review evaluation above serves as the cross-review. State this explicitly in the report.

If you are the same agent that built the feature, note: "Self-reviewed only. Cross-review by a different agent is recommended before merge."

PR CREATE (only for features that passed review)
Read the PR template at /.github/pull_request_template.md if it exists.
Read the full diff of the feature branch against the target branch.

Produce the pull request:
- Title: concise imperative summary
- What: one sentence
- Why: link to /specs/[feature-id]-[slug].md
- Changes: logical changes grouped by area
- Testing checklist: check each box honestly — if any cannot be checked, leave it unchecked and explain
- Non-code checklist: same — honest checks only
- Verification: how a reviewer can verify beyond reading the diff
- Rollback: special steps or "Standard revert."
- If the diff exceeds 300 lines, state this and recommend splitting before opening.

Open the PR against the target branch.
State: "PR created for [feature-id]-[slug]. Ready for human review."

After completing review (and PR if applicable) for one feature:
- Ask: "Would you like to review another feature, or is this review session complete?"

If another feature: ask for the next feature name and repeat from the Review phase.
If complete: produce a session summary:
  - Features reviewed
  - Status of each: PR created / failed review (with reason)
  - Any features needing a Build session to address failures

State: "All features that passed review have open PRs. Remaining items need Build sessions to address review failures. Human review can proceed on the open PRs — estimated 10 minutes per PR using the non-code checklist."
```

**Output per feature:** A PASS/FAIL review report and, if passed, an open pull request.

**Output at session end:** A summary of all features reviewed and their disposition.

**Human Review (not a meta-prompt):**
Human review is human-driven. The PR's non-code checklist is designed for a reviewer who does not need to read code. The checklist covers: scope match against spec, diff size, file scope, secrets, test evidence, commit messages, cross-review status, and rollback path. Estimated time: 10 minutes per PR. On approval: merge, delete the branch, label the issue `status:done`.

## Session Flow Summary

```text
BUILD (autonomous, one feature per session)
  Test   → Committed failing tests
  Implement → Committed code   ↺ repeat per task
  → Resume in fresh session if context constrained

REVIEW & SHIP (batch)
  Review → PASS/FAIL report   ↰ fail sends back to Build
  PR Create (on pass)
  → "Review another?" loop

HUMAN
  Merge via non-code checklist → Done
```
