# Boundaries & Bug Tracking

> Referenced from `AGENTS.md`. This is part of the canonical workflow — see `/governance/REGISTRY.md`.

## Boundaries

### ALWAYS

- Read the spec before implementation
- Run tests before commit
- Include acceptance criteria evidence in every PR
- Follow branch naming conventions
- Reference the constitution for alignment on any design decision
- After every workflow action, append a structured entry to experiment-log.md per workflow/EXPERIMENT_OBSERVER.md

### ASK FIRST

- Adding new dependencies
- Modifying CI workflows
- Changing the constitution (use `/compass-edit`)
- Modifying this file (`AGENTS.md`)
- Architectural decisions not covered by the spec

### NEVER

- Commit secrets or `.env` files
- Modify files outside the assigned scope
- Auto-merge without human approval
- Skip tests
- Make decisions not traceable to a spec or constitution principle

## Bug Tracking

Use `/bug` (Claude) or `bug.prompt.md` (Copilot) from any phase:

```
Description: [what's wrong]
Location: [file:line or component]
Phase found: [which phase discovered this]
Severity: blocking | non-blocking
Expected: [what should happen]
Actual: [what does happen]
Fix-as-you-go: yes | no
```

- Small bugs (fix-as-you-go = yes): fix in place, log the fix
- Large bugs: add to backlog as a spec, assign model + branch when picked up
- Backlog review cycle: treat queued bugs as specs with full AC/branch/model assignment
