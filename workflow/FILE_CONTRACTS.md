## Artifact Directory Map

```
.specify/
  constitution.md                    ← project identity (written in Phase 2)
  spec-template.md                   ← copy to /specs/ for each new feature
  acceptance-criteria-template.md    ← AC format reference (EARS + GWT)

/specs/[feature-id]-[slug].md        ← one per feature (created in Phase 3+)
/tasks/[feature-id]-[slug].md        ← one per feature (authoritative execution artifact; created in Phase 5+)
/decisions/[NNNN]-[slug].md          ← architecture choices (any phase)
/bugs/LOG.md                         ← append-only bug log (any phase)
/.codex/PLANS.md                     ← Codex long-run execution plan (Phase 6+)
/workflow/STATE.json                 ← orchestration state for /continue
```

Feature ID format: `[issue-id]-[slug]` (example: `42-user-auth`). Spec and task files share the same feature ID.

# File Contracts

Machine-readable behavior starts with stable artifact contracts.

## Artifact Contracts

| Artifact | Owner | Updated When | Required Fields | Validation Signal |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------------- |
| `.specify/constitution.md` | Compass interview | Phase 2 (Compass) or `/compass-edit` | 8 sections: Problem, User, Success, Capabilities, Out-of-Scope, Principles, Security, Testing | No `[PROJECT-SPECIFIC]` placeholders remain |
| `/specs/[feature-id]-[slug].md` | Builder agent | Scope changes | Feature ID, criteria IDs, affected areas, out-of-scope, Compass mapping | Criteria count 3–7 and IDs present |
| `/tasks/[feature-id]-[slug].md` | Builder agent | Plan + every task completion | Task IDs, criterion mapping, status counts, session log, model assignment, branch name | All criteria mapped, status math consistent |
| `/decisions/[NNNN]-[slug].md` | Builder/reviewer/human | Non-obvious forks or conflicts | Trigger, options, decision, consequences, rollback impact | Decision linked from task/spec when needed |
| `/bugs/LOG.md` | Any agent via `/bug` | Bug discovered in any phase | BUG-NNN, description, location, phase, severity, expected, actual, status | Sequential BUG-NNN IDs, status field present |
| `/.codex/PLANS.md` (instance copy) | Builder agent | Long-run execution only | Milestones, verification, progress | Milestones map to task IDs |
| `/workflow/STATE.json` | Orchestrator (`/continue`) | Phase transitions and task selection | `projectPhase`, `currentFeatureId`, `currentTaskFile`, `testMode`, `updatedAt` (`schemaVersion` optional) | Valid JSON and phase/task references resolve |
| Review report in PR body | Reviewer agent | Review phase | PASS/FAIL per criterion + scope checks + rubric scores | No unchecked criterion |
| `workflow/ROUTING.md` | Human maintainer | Agent model changes | Routing matrix, branch format, concurrency rules | Tables present and non-empty |
| `workflow/COMMANDS.md` | Human maintainer | Phase 4+ | Command table, conventions | No placeholder after Phase 5 |
| `workflow/BOUNDARIES.md` | Human maintainer | Policy changes | ALWAYS/ASK/NEVER sections | All three sections present |

## Linkage Rules

- Feature ID format: `[issue-id]-[slug]` (example: `42-user-auth`).
- Spec filename and task filename share the same feature ID.
- Acceptance criteria IDs use `AC-1..N`.
- Tasks use `T-1..N` and must cite covered `AC-*` IDs.
- Decisions referenced by ID in tasks or PR when they affect behavior.
- `/workflow/STATE.json` `currentTaskFile` must point to an existing `/tasks/[feature-id]-[slug].md`.

## Invalid State Conditions

Treat as blocking failures:

- Spec exists without a matching task file.
- Any criterion has no test mapping.
- Task status counts do not match task checklist states.
- Out-of-scope files changed with no decision record.
- PR missing verification or rollback sections.
- `workflow/STATE.json` points to a missing task file or invalid phase identifier.

## Specification Writing

All work flows from specifications:

1. Read `.specify/constitution.md` before any implementation — it is the project's identity
2. Check `/specs/` for the current feature spec (copy `.specify/spec-template.md` when creating new specs)
3. Create or update `/tasks/[feature-id]-[slug].md` during Phase 5 — this is the authoritative execution artifact
4. Write acceptance criteria using `.specify/acceptance-criteria-template.md` as reference
5. Verify all acceptance criteria pass before creating a PR

### Acceptance Criteria Notation

This project uses **GWT (Given/When/Then)** notation for all acceptance criteria, based on the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) framework.

#### Format

```
GIVEN [precondition or initial state],
WHEN [action or event],
THEN [expected outcome or observable result].
```

#### EARS Extensions

| Pattern | Use When | Example |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `GIVEN...WHEN...THEN` | Standard behavior | GIVEN a logged-in user, WHEN they click logout, THEN the session is destroyed |
| `WHILE...WHEN...THEN` | State-dependent behavior | WHILE the server is offline, WHEN a request arrives, THEN it is queued locally |
| `WHERE...WHEN...THEN` | Conditional features | WHERE dark mode is enabled, WHEN the page loads, THEN the dark theme is applied |
| `IF...THEN` | Unconditional requirement | IF the input is empty, THEN display a validation error |

#### Why GWT?

- **Translatable to tests:** Each GWT criterion maps directly to a test: the GIVEN is the setup, the WHEN is the action, the THEN is the assertion.
- **Machine-verifiable:** Agents can parse GWT format to auto-generate test skeletons.
- **Prevents vague criteria:** Forces specificity about preconditions and expected outcomes.

#### Anti-patterns

- ❌ `AC-1: The system should work correctly` — not testable
- ❌ `AC-1: Users should be able to log in` — no precondition or expected outcome
- ✅ `AC-1: GIVEN valid credentials, WHEN the user submits the login form, THEN the system redirects to the dashboard and sets a session cookie`
