# Concurrency Safety

Rules and strategies for running multiple agents on the same codebase simultaneously.

## Core Rule

> If two agents need to modify the same file, the split is wrong.

Redesign the task decomposition until each agent has exclusive file ownership.

## Worktree Isolation

Every agent gets an isolated worktree via `scripts/setup-worktree.sh <model> <type> <description>`.

- Directory: `.trees/<model>-<type>-<description>/`
- Branch: `<model>/<type>-<description>`
- Max parallel agents: 3 (configurable in this file)
- Inventory: `scripts/setup-worktree.sh --list`
- Cleanup: `scripts/setup-worktree.sh --cleanup`
- Conflict check: `scripts/clash-check.sh`

## Task Decomposition Strategies

### Strategy 1: Vertical Slice (Preferred)

Each agent builds an entire feature slice (route → controller → validation → tests).
- ✅ No file overlap
- ✅ Each agent is self-contained
- ❌ Requires careful interface design up front

### Strategy 2: Interface Contract

Define API contracts and data types FIRST, then agents code against agreed interfaces independently.
- ✅ Enables true parallel work
- ✅ Single source of truth (types/schemas)
- ❌ Requires freeze on interfaces early

### Strategy 3: Dependency-Graph

Group files by import relationships; assign each group to one agent.
- ✅ Respects natural code boundaries
- ❌ Complex for highly interconnected codebases

### Strategy 4: Role-Based Routing

Use the Agent Routing Matrix in `workflow/ROUTING.md`:
- Claude: complex reasoning, refactoring, bug diagnosis
- Copilot: UI work, documentation, boilerplate
- Codex: batch operations, migrations, CI/CD

## Drift Detection

**Agentic drift**: gradual, invisible divergence when parallel agents encode different assumptions in code that merges cleanly but contains contradictory logic.

### Prevention
- Short integration cycles: merge every few hours, not days
- Pre-write conflict check: `scripts/clash-check.sh` before starting work
- Interface contracts: define types/schemas before implementation
- Vertical slices: minimize shared file surface area

### Detection
- Post-merge, run full test suite (catches behavioral conflicts)
- Review merged code for contradictory patterns
- Track which agents modified which files across branches

## Safety Limits

| Limit | Value | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Max parallel agents | 3 | Integration tax is nonlinear |
| Max worktree age | 24h | Stale worktrees drift |
| Conflict check frequency | Before each commit | Catches overlaps early |
| Integration cycle | Every 4-8 hours | Prevents drift accumulation |

## Runtime Isolation

Worktrees share the host machine. Prevent resource conflicts:

- **Ports**: Allocate unique dev server port per worktree (e.g., base_port + worktree_index)
- **Databases**: Use separate database files per worktree (e.g., `.trees/<name>/dev.db`)
- **Docker**: Use unique container names per worktree
- **Temp files**: Use worktree-specific temp directories
