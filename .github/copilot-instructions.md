# Copilot Instructions

> **Routing & conventions:** Follow the rules in ../AGENTS.md. If any instruction below conflicts with AGENTS.md, AGENTS.md takes precedence.

## Project Standards

- Read `/AGENTS.md` before starting any task
- Follow `/workflow/PLAYBOOK.md` for phase gates and `/workflow/FILE_CONTRACTS.md` for artifact requirements
- Follow `/workflow/FAILURE_ROUTING.md` when blocked

## Completions

Follow naming conventions and patterns from `AGENTS.md` Code Conventions section.

## Code Review

- Flag functions over 50 lines
- Flag nesting deeper than 3 levels
- Flag missing error handling on I/O operations
- Flag tests that assert only the happy path
- Flag hardcoded values that should be configuration
- Verify every acceptance criterion from the linked spec has a test
- Verify task file criteria mappings (`AC-*`) align with tests and PR evidence

## PR Descriptions

- State what changed, why, and how to verify
- Link the Feature ID plus matching spec/task files
- List files changed, grouped by concern

## Coding Agent

- Read the linked spec before starting
- Do not modify files outside the scope described in the issue
- Treat `/AGENTS.md` and `/workflow/*.md` as canonical; do not redefine policy in ad hoc notes

## Session Bootstrap

At the start of every session:
1. Read `AGENTS.md` for project conventions and phase navigation
2. Read `workflow/STATE.json` for current project state
3. If a task is active, read the task file from `/tasks/`

See `workflow/ORCHESTRATOR.md` for the full loop contract.
