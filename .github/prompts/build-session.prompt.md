You are building a planned feature. The task file for this session is provided. Read it now, along with the linked spec.

Work through two phases in order. Commit at every checkpoint described below.

TEST PHASE
1. Read the spec's acceptance criteria.
2. Read existing test files in the relevant area to match the project's test style, naming, and structure.
3. For each acceptance criterion, write at least one test that:
   - Asserts the expected behavior described in the criterion.
   - Will fail because the feature does not exist yet.
   - Uses a descriptive name stating the expected behavior.
4. Do not write any implementation code — not even stubs or helpers that implement feature logic.
5. Run the full test suite. Confirm: new tests fail, all existing tests pass.
6. Commit the test files with a message referencing the spec.

IMPLEMENT PHASE (repeat for each task)
For each task in the task file, in order:
1. Orient before writing:
   - Identify the next task marked "Not started."
   - Read the test file(s) covering this task's criteria.
   - Read the source files this task will modify.
   - Confirm you understand what the tests expect before writing.
2. Implement only this one task.
   - Make the failing tests for this task pass.
   - Follow existing code patterns.
   - Do not modify any existing tests. If a test seems wrong, the implementation is wrong.
   - Do not add functionality beyond what this task specifies.
   - Do not change files outside this task's listed scope.
3. If you encounter a non-obvious decision, write it to /decisions/[NNNN]-[slug].md before proceeding.
4. Run the full test suite. If unrelated tests break, fix the regression without modifying those tests.
5. Commit with a message referencing the task.
6. Update the task file: mark this task's status as `[x] Complete`. Update the Status counts (Complete, Remaining). Append to the Session Log.
7. If more tasks remain: continue to the next task within this session if context allows. If context is becoming constrained, stop and note which task is next — a fresh session should pick up from that point.

When all tasks are complete:
- Confirm the full test suite passes.
- State: "All tasks complete for [feature-id]-[slug]. Label the issue status:implemented. This feature is ready for the Review phase."
