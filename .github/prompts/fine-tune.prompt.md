# Phase 5 — Fine-tune Plan

**Objective:** Finalize the build plan: order task breakdowns, write acceptance criteria, assign models, and create branch names.

**Trigger:** Phase 4 complete (architecture plan exists, AGENTS.md populated).

**Entry commands:**
- Claude: `/fine-tune`
- Copilot: `fine-tune.prompt.md`

---

## What Happens

1. For each feature spec, create or update `/tasks/[feature-id]-[slug].md` as the authoritative execution artifact
2. Produce an ordered list of tasks sized for one commit
3. Write acceptance criteria using EARS + GWT formats:
   - **EARS:** `When [trigger], the system shall [response]`
   - **GWT:** `Given [context], When [action], Then [outcome]`
4. Each criterion is a machine-parseable checkbox: `- [ ] criterion`
5. Assign models using `AGENTS.md → Agent Routing Matrix`
6. Name branches using `AGENTS.md → Branch Naming`: `model/type-short-description`
7. Note which model will review each task (different from implementer)

## Gate

- Every active feature spec has a matching task file in `/tasks/`
- Task breakdowns exist with ordered tasks
- All ACs use EARS/GWT format and are machine-parseable checkboxes
- Model assignments present for every task
- Branch names follow convention
- Second-model review assignments documented

## Output

- Updated feature specs with ordered tasks and ACs
- Updated `/tasks/[feature-id]-[slug].md` files with task status scaffold, AC mappings, and branch/model assignment
- Model assignments and branch names recorded
- Summary table for developer approval
